# SOLID PRINCIPLES

    S - Single Responsibility
    O - Open Closed
    L - Liskov Substitution
    I - Interface Segregation
    D - Dependency Inversion

### Single Responsibility
Each class should have only one sole purpose and not be filled with excessive functionality.

### Open Closed
Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification. <br>
You should not have to rewrite on existing class for implementing new features.

### Liskov Substitution
Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

### Interface Segregation
Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do. <br>
Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

### Dependency Inversion
Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
